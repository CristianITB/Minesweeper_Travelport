Feature: Minesweeper
Here are some definitions and aclarations about the syntax that will be used:

"1, 2" means row 1 column 2, understanding that there's no row 0 nor column 0
"x" stands for cell with a mine
"o" stands for an empty cell
"1" stands for a cell with 1 adjacent mine
"2" stands for a cell with 2 adjacent mines
"3" stands for a cell with 3 adjacent mines
"4" stands for a cell with 4 adjacent mines
"5" stands for a cell with 5 adjacent mines
"6" stands for a cell with 6 adjacent mines
"7" stands for a cell with 7 adjacent mines
"8" stands for a cell with 8 adjacent mines

"Suspected cell" stands for a cell that is tagged as "!" meaning there's a potential mine on it,
whereas "questionable cell" stands for a cell tagged as "?" meaning it isn't exactly known the value of the cell.

Also, to load the mock data, it'll be used the following syntax:
"ooo-oxo-ooo" stands for a 3x3 board, where the "-" defines when a new row does start.
So "xo" would define a 1 row and 2 columns board, and "xoo-ooo" a board with 2 rows and 3 columns. 

Background:
Given a user opens the app

Scenario: Default screen
Then the display should show an 8x8 cells board
And all the cells should be covered
And the mineCounter should be set at 10
And the timeDisplay should be empty

Scenario: Unleashing a cell: Cell with a mine -> Game over
Given the user loads the following mock data: "xo"
When the user unleash the cell "1, 1"
Then the cell "1, 1" should show a bomb
And the game should be over
And all the non-marked as suspected mines should be discovered  ---------------> doesnt make sense in this "xo" scenario

Scenario Outline: Unleashing a cell: Cell without mine, but with adjacent mined cells -> Should show the number of adjacent mines
Given the user loads the following mock data: "<mockData>"
When the user unleash the cell "2, 2"  
Then the cell "2, 2" should show the following value: "<cellValue>"

Examples: 
|  mockData   | cellValue |
| ooo-xoo-ooo |     1     |
| xox-ooo-ooo |     2     |
| xoo-xoo-oox |     3     |
| xox-xox-ooo |     4     |
| xxx-xoo-oxo |     5     |
| xox-oox-xxx |     6     |
| xxx-xox-xox |     7     |
| xxx-xox-xxx |     8     |


Scenario: Tagging a cell: if the user believes there's a mine in a cell, it can be tagged as suspected -> mine counter decreases
Given "mineCounter" is 10
When the user tags the cell "1, 1" as suspected
Then the cell "1, 1" should show the tag symbol "!"
And "mineCounter" should be 9

Scenario: Tagging a cell: if the user doesn't know the value of a cell, it can be tagged as questionable -> mine counter increases
Given "mineCounter" is 9
When the user tags the cell "1, 1" as questionable
Then the cell "1, 1" should show the tag symbol "?"
And "mineCounter" should be 10

Scenario: Change tag from suspected to questionable with the mouse
Given the cell "1, 1" is tagged as suspected
And the "mineCounter" is 9
When the user right clicks on the cell "1, 1"
Then the cell "1, 1" should be tagged as questionable
And the "mineCounter" is 10 

Scenario: Untag a questionable cell
Given the cell "1, 1" is tagged as questionable
When the user untags the cell "1, 1"
Then the questionable tag in cell "1, 1" should be removed 

Scenario Outline: Reduce mine counter when tagging a cell as suspected
Given the mineCounter display shows the following value: "<mineCounterDisplay>"
When the user tags the cell "1, 1" as suspected
Then the mineCounter display should show the following value: "<displayResult>"

Examples:

|          10        |       9       |
|           9        |       8       |
|           3        |       2       |
|           1        |       0       |
|           0        |      -1       |

Scenario Outline: Increase mine counter when tagging a cell as questionable
Given the mineCounter display shows the following value: "<mineCounterDisplay>"

Examples:
| mineCounterDisplay | displayResult |
|           9        |      10       |
|           8        |       9       |
|           1        |       2       |
|           0        |       1       |
|          -1        |       0       |
|          -2        |      -1       |


Scenario Outline: Increase mine counter when discovering a suspected cell
Given the mineCounter display shows the following value: "<mineCounterDisplay>"
And the cell "1, 1" is tagged as suspected
When the user discovers the cell "1, 1"
